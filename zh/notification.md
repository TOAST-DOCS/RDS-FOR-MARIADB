## Event

Event refers to an important event that occurs either by RDS for MariaDB or by user. Event consists of the event type, the date and time of occurrence, the original source and the message. Event can be viewed from the web console, and you can receive notifications of event occurrence by email or SMS through subscription. The event type and the possible events are as follows.

## Subscribe to Event

You can subscribe to events by event type, code, and source. When you subscribe by event type, you will be notified of all the event codes included in the event type. If the notification is too broad, you can subscribe by event code and source. You can select only project members as the users to receive notifications. By default, event notifications are sent by email, and additional event notifications are sent by SMS only if mobile phone number with real name authentication is registered.

## Notification Group

Notification group allows you to receive notifications about performance metrics. Specify which instances are monitored in the notification group and which user groups are notified. Set the thresholds and conditions for performance metrics to be notified through the monitoring settings. Once the set metrics meet the conditions in the monitoring settings, notifications to the associated user groups are sent. Notifications are sent by SMS or email, depending on the type of notification set in the notification group.

### Create Notification Group

## Monitoring Settings

The monitoring settings consist of items, comparison method, threshold, and duration. Compare the performance metrics and threshold values of monitoring items to determine if the conditions are met. Notification is sent if the condition is met continuously for longer than the duration. For example, if the CPU usage rate is greater than 90% and the duration is 5 minutes, sends notifications to users defined in user groups, when the DB instance linked with that notification group has sustained CPU usage rate of 90% or higher for more than 5 minutes. Notification is not sent, even though CPU usage rate reaches 90% or higher but it falls below 90% within 5 minutes.

### Monitoring Settings Items

Performance metrics items that can be monitored are as follows.
