## Process List, InnoDB Status

RDS for MariaDB collects queries performed on the database and the status of the InnoDB engine. The results of `information_schema.processlist`and `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS`are collected once per second, and you can view the last four days of data in the Analytics tab of the console.

> [Note] The collected data is stored in internal backup storage and is not charged separately.

The following items are collected

| Item            | Description                                                |

## Slow Query

RDS for MariaDB analyzes the slow queries that occurred in your database and collects the results. It performs analysis once a minute using pt-query-digest, a query analysis tool provided by Percona, and you can view the last 30 days of data in the Analysis tab of the console.

> [Note] You can disable the Slow Query analysis feature on the Modify DB Instance screen.

The following items are collected.

| Item             | Description                        |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Checksum       | Checksum for abstracted queries      |
| Total ExecTime | Total execution time (seconds)               |
| Avg ExecTime   | Average time to perform (seconds)               |
| Max ExecTime   | Maximum time to perform (in seconds)               |
| Min ExecTime   | Minimum time to perform (in seconds)               |
| Query Count    | Number of queries issued                  |
| Query          | Abstracted queries so you can group similar queries together |

> [Caution]
> If the value of the slow_query_log parameter is 0, no Slow Query logs are left and no analysis results are collected.
> If the DB instance is heavily loaded, Slow Query analysis may be delayed or analysis results may be lost.
